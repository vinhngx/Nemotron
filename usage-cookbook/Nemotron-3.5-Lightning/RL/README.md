# Nemotron-3.5-Lightning RL Training Cookbook

This directory contains NeMo RL training guides for
[Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16).

- `grpo-dapo/`: direct DAPO/GRPO convergence training with NeMo RL's native
  math environment.
- `grpo-dapo-nemo-gym/`: DAPO/GRPO training that routes rollout and reward
  handling through [NeMo Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym).

The recipes assume a shared filesystem mounted into the training container at
`/shared`, following the convention used in the Nemotron RL cookbooks:

```text
/shared                         <- Mount point for </YOUR/SHARED/STORAGE>
|____code
|    |____RL                    <- NeMo RL root repository
|    |____Nemotron              <- Public repository containing this cookbook
|____models
|____runs
|____.cache/huggingface
```

Run the commands in this root README from the login/head node, outside a Slurm
allocation. The detailed workflow guides contain the allocation and driver
commands.

## Hardware Requirements

The supported Lightning configuration was tested on one DGX H100 node (eight
H100 GPUs) managed by Slurm, with a shared filesystem visible from every node
and mounted at `/shared` in the container, and an accessible Docker registry per your Slurm setup.

## Clone the Repositories

Clone NeMo RL and the public [Nemotron cookbook repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/tree/main/usage-cookbook)
onto shared storage. The guides refer to these checkouts as `${NEMO_RL}` and
`${NEMOTRON_REPO}`.

Run from the login/head node:

```bash
export SHARED_ROOT=$(realpath </YOUR/SHARED/STORAGE>)
export NEMO_RL="${SHARED_ROOT}/code/RL"
export NEMOTRON_REPO="${SHARED_ROOT}/code/Nemotron"

mkdir -p "${SHARED_ROOT}/code"
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL.git "${NEMO_RL}"
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron.git "${NEMOTRON_REPO}"
cd "${NEMO_RL}"
```

If the checkout was created without `--recursive`, initialize its submodules
before building an image or launching training:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Container

Build the public NeMo RL release image from the checked-out repository. Run
this from a node that support docker build:

```bash
cd "${NEMO_RL}"

docker buildx build \
  --progress=plain \
  --build-context nemo-rl=. \
  -f docker/Dockerfile \
  --target release \
  --build-arg SKIP_SGLANG_BUILD=1 \
  --build-arg SKIP_TRTLLM_BUILD=1 \
  -t nemo-rl:nemotron-3.5-lightning \
  .
```

Use the container format and Slurm integration required by your site when
following the detailed workflow guides. This might entail pushing the image to a central Docker registry.


## Install Hugging Face Tools

Run from the login/head node:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade --user "huggingface_hub[cli]" datasets
hf auth login
```

The `datasets` package is required only for the NeMo Gym guide, which converts
DAPO-Math data into Gym JSONL files on the login/head node.

## Environment File (optional)

Store credentials in `${SHARED_ROOT}/.env`. For example:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<YOUR_WANDB_API_KEY>
export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>
```

## Download the Model

Download the checkpoint once on shared storage.

Run from the login/head node:

```bash
export MODEL_DIR="${SHARED_ROOT}/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16"
export HF_HOME="${SHARED_ROOT}/.cache/huggingface"

mkdir -p "${MODEL_DIR}" "${HF_HOME}"
hf download nvidia/Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16 \
  --local-dir "${MODEL_DIR}"
```

The recipes refer to the mounted model as:

```text
/shared/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16
```

## What to Run Next

Use [grpo-dapo/grpo_training_cookbook.md](grpo-dapo/grpo_training_cookbook.md)
for direct DAPO/GRPO convergence training, or
[grpo-dapo-nemo-gym/grpo_training_cookbook_nemo_gym.md](grpo-dapo-nemo-gym/grpo_training_cookbook_nemo_gym.md)
for the NeMo Gym path.

The recipes use 160 training steps, checkpoints every 10 steps,
validates every 20 steps with 128 samples, and logs to W&B.
